# STARK proof verifier
This crate contains an implementation of STARK verifier which can verify proofs generated by a prover from the [prover](../prover) crate.

## Usage
To verify a proof you can use `Verifier.verify()` method. To invoke this method, you first need to instantiate a verifier like so:
```Rust
let verifier = Verifier::<TransitionEvaluator, AssertionEvaluator>::new();
```
where:

* `TransitionEvaluator` describes how transition constraints for the computation are to be evaluated.
* `AssertionEvaluator` describes how assertion constraints for the computation are to be evaluated.

Once the verifier is instantiated, you can use it verify proofs like so:
```Rust
match verifier.verify(proof, assertions) {
    Ok(_) => debug!("Proof verified!"),
    Err(msg) => debug!("Failed to verify proof: {}", msg),
}
```
where:

* `proof` is the proof of the computation generated by the prover.
* `assertions` is a set of assertions the prover made against the computation's execution trace.
