# Winterfell
This is an experimental project for building a distributed STARK prover.

## Project structure
The project is organized into several crates like so:

| Crate                | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| [math](math)         | Contains modules with math operations needed in STARK proof generation/verification. These include: finite field arithmetic, polynomial arithmetic, and FFTs. |
| [crypto](crypto)     | Contains modules with cryptographic operations needed in STARK proof generation/verification. Specifically: hash functions and Merkle trees.
| [prover](prover)     | Contains implementations of STARK provers. You can use these to generate proofs of computations.
| [verifier](verifier) | Contains an implementation of STARK verifier which can verify proofs generated by a prover. |
| [common](common)     | Contains modules with components shared between the prover and the verifier. |
| [examples](examples) | Contains examples of proof generation/verification illustrating how to use this library. |

## References
A STARK is a novel proof-of-computation scheme that allows you to create an efficiently verifiable proof that a computation was executed correctly. The scheme was developed by Eli-Ben Sasson and team at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. STARKs do not require an initial trusted setup, and rely on very few cryptographic assumptions.
